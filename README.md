## 🧩 Module: Prompt Log and PR Review — Added Work

This repository now includes a new folder: **`shopsmart/`** with an e‑commerce landing page styled using **CSS only**.

### What was done
- Implemented layout, colors, fonts, hover effects, and responsiveness.
- Logged at least 5 prompts with summaries, implementations, and reflections in `shopsmart/PROMPT_LOG.md`.
- Provided a submission write‑up template below.

### How to run
Open `shopsmart/index.html` in your browser. No build step needed.

### Submission Answers (Template)
**Describe the prompts you used in your work.**
- What did you ask the AI to help you with? → See `shopsmart/PROMPT_LOG.md` (entries 1–6).
- What suggestions did the AI give, and what did you implement? → Summarize which parts you used (hero centering, grid spans, button hover, sticky header, image aspect‑ratio, theme variables).
- What did you learn through this process? → e.g., grid centering pattern, aspect‑ratio for stable cards, benefits of CSS variables.

**Review someone else’s use of AI prompts.**
- Whose pull request (PR) did you review? → _Add teammate name + PR link_
- What was interesting or effective about their prompts? → _e.g., they asked AI to simplify media queries into clamp() sizing_
- How did their approach differ from yours, and what might you try next time? → _e.g., try fluid typography, use container queries, or prefers-reduced-motion checks_

### Sample PR Review Comments (you can paste to GitHub)
1. “The way you guided the AI to produce a grid that degrades to a single column is neat. Could you share the exact prompt for your breakpoints? I want to compare with my span‑based approach.”
2. “Nice call asking AI for a low‑motion hover effect. It reads well for accessibility; did you consider adding `prefers-reduced-motion`? If you have the prompt, I’d love to try it.”
